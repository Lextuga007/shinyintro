# Basic Patterns

Welcome to Day 2!. Today we'll expand on what we learned in Day 1 to cover input and output in more depth. We'll also learn how to read and write data to and from files.

In the second half of Day 2, we'll expand what we've learned about reactivity and practice some common reactive patterns.

## Different input types {#input_functions}

Inputs are ways that users can communicate information to the Shiny app. Explore some different input types in the embedded app below before you read about how to set up each type. You can run this app locally with `shinyintro::app("input_demo")` or view it in a separate tab with the [showcase interface](<https://shiny.psy.gla.ac.uk/debruine/input_demo/({target="_blank"}.

</div>

### textInput

`textInput()` creates a one-line box for short text input.


```r
demo_text <- 
  textInput("demo_text", 
            label = "Name", 
            value = "", 
            width = "100%",
            placeholder = "Your Name")
```

### textAreaInput

`textAreaInput()` creates a multi-line box for longer text input.


```r
demo_textarea <- 
  textAreaInput("demo_textarea", 
                label = "Biography", 
                value = "",
                width = "100%",
                rows = 5, 
                placeholder = "Tell us something interesting about you.")
```

### selectInput

`sekectInput()` creates a drop-down menu. Set the first choice to `""` to default to `NA`. If your choices are a named list, the names are what is shown and the values are what is recorded. If the choices aren't named, the displayed and recorded values are the same.


```r
demo_select <- 
  selectInput("demo_select", 
              label = "Do you like Shiny?", 
              choices = list("", 
                             "Yes, I do" = "y", 
                             "No, I don't" = "n"),
              selected = NULL,
              width = "100%")
```

You can also make a select where users can choose multiple options.


```r
genders <- list( # no blank needed
  "Non-binary" = "nb",
  "Male" = "m",
  "Female" = "f",
  "Agender" = "a",
  "Gender Fluid" = "gf"
)

demo_select_multi <- 
  selectInput("demo_select2", 
              label = "Gender (select all that apply)", 
              choices = genders,
              selected = NULL,
              multiple = TRUE, 
              selectize = FALSE,
              size = 5)
```

### checkboxGroupInput

However, this interface almost always looks better with a checkbox group. 


```r
demo_cbgi <-
  checkboxGroupInput("demo_cbgi",
                     label = "Gender (select all that apply)",
                     choices = genders)
```

### checkboxInput

You can also make a single checkbox. The value is `TRUE` when checked and `FALSE` when not.


```r
demo_cb <- checkboxInput("demo_cb",
  label = "I love R",
  value = TRUE)
```

Sliders allow you to choose numbers between a minimum and maximum.


```r
demo_slider <- sliderInput("demo_slider",
                           label = "Age",
                           min = 0,
                           max = 100,
                           value = 0,
                           step = 1,
                           width = "100%")
```


### Setting inputs programatically

Sometimes you need to change the value of an input with code, such as when resetting a questionnaire or in response to an answer on another item. The following code reseats all of the inputs above.


```r
updateTextInput(session, "demo_text", value = "")
updateTextAreaInput(session, "demo_textarea", value = "")
updateSelectInput(session, "demo_select", selected = "")
updateCheckboxGroupInput(session, "demo_cbgi", selected = character(0))
updateCheckboxInput(session, "demo_cb", value = TRUE)
updateSliderInput(session, "demo_slider", value = 0)
```

<div class="warning">
<p>Note that select inputs and checkbox groups use the argument <code>selected</code> and not <code>value</code>. If you want to set all the values in a checkbox group to unchecked, set <code>selected = character(0)</code>.</p>
</div>


## Different output types {#output_functions}

Output are ways that the Shiny app can dynamically display information to the user. In the user interface (UI), you create outputs with IDs that you reference in and associated rendering function inside the server function.

Explore some different output types in the embedded app below before you read about how to set up each type. You can run this app locally with `shinyintro::app("output_demo")` or view it in a separate tab with the [showcase interface](<https://shiny.psy.gla.ac.uk/debruine/output_demo/({target="_blank"}.

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<iframe src="https://shiny.psy.gla.ac.uk/debruine/output_demo/?showcase=0" width="100%" height="800px"></iframe>
<p class="caption">(\#fig:output-demo-app)Output Demo App</p>
</div>

### textOutput

The function `textOutput()` defaults to text inside a `<span>` or `<div>` element, but you can use a different element with the `container` argument.


```r
# in the UI
textOutput("demo_text", container = tags$h3)

# in the server function
output$demo_text <- renderText({
    sprintf("Plot of %s", input$y)
})
```

If you use `verbatimTextOutput()` in the UI (no change to the server function), it will show the output in a fixed-width font. This can be good for code or text you want the user to copy.


```r
# in the UI
verbatimTextOutput("demo_verbatim")

# in the server function
output$demo_verbatim <- renderText({
        code <- 
"ggplot(iris, aes(x = Species, y = %s, color = Species)) +
    geom_violin(show.legend = FALSE) +
    stat_summary(show.legend = FALSE)"
        
        sprintf(code, input$y)
    })
```

### uiOutput

If you want to dynamically create parts of the user interface (UI), you can use `uiOutput()`. You can create the user interface using the [input functions](#input_functions)


```r
# in the UI
uiOutput("demo_ui")

# in the server function
output$demo_ui <- renderUI({
  cols <- names(iris)[1:4]
  selectInput("y", "Column to plot", cols, "Sepal.Length")
})
```

<div class="info">
<p>The function <code>htmlOutput()</code> is exactly the same as <code>uiOutput()</code>, so you might see that in some code examples, but I use <code>uiOutput()</code> to make the connection with <code>renderUI()</code> clearer, since there is no <code>renderHTML()</code>.</p>
</div>



### plotOutput


```r
# in the UI
plotOutput("demo_plot")

# in the server function
output$demo_plot <- renderPlot({
  ggplot(iris, aes(x = Species, y = .data[[input$y]], color = Species)) +
    geom_violin(show.legend = FALSE) +
    stat_summary(show.legend = FALSE) +
    ylab(input$y)
})
```

<div class="warning">
<p>If you want to create dynamic plots that change with input, note how you need to use <code>y = .data[[input$y]]</code> inside the <code>aes()</code> function, instead of just <code>y = input$y</code>.</p>
</div>

### imageOutput


```r
# in the UI
imageOutput("demo_image")

# in the server function
output$demo_image <- renderImage({
    list(src = "images/flower.jpg",
         width = 100,
         height = 100,
         alt = "A flower")
}, deleteFile = FALSE)
```

You can dynamically display images of any type, but one of the most useful ways to use image outputs is to control the aspect ratio and relative size of plots. When you save a temporary file, you should set `deleteFile = TRUE` in the `renderImage()` function (this stops unneeded plots using memory).


```r
# in the UI
imageOutput("demo_image")

# in the server function
output$demo_image <- renderImage({
  # make the plot
  g <- ggplot(iris, aes(x = Species, y = .data[[input$y]], color = Species)) +
    geom_violin(show.legend = FALSE) +
    stat_summary(show.legend = FALSE) +
    ylab(input$y)
  
  # save to a temporary file
  plot_file <- tempfile(fileext = ".png")

  ggsave(plot_file, demo_plot(), units = "in",
         dpi = 72, width = 7, height = 5)
    
  # Return a list containing the filename
  list(src = plot_file,
       width = "100%", # don't set the height to keep aspect ratio
       alt = "The plot")
}, deleteFile = TRUE)
```

### tableOutput

The `reanderTable()` function will display a table from any data frame it returns.


```r
# in the UI
tableOutput("demo_table")

# in the server function
output$demo_table <- renderTable({
  iris %>%
    group_by(Species) %>%
    summarise(mean = mean(.data[[input$y]]),
              sd = sd(.data[[input$y]]))
})
```

<div class="warning">
<p>Note how you need to use <code>.data[[input$y]]</code> inside the <code>dplyr::summarise()</code> function, instead of just <code>input$y</code> to dynamically choose which variable to summarise.</p>
</div>

### dataTableOutput

If you have a long table to show, or one that you want users to be able to sort or search, use `dataTableOutput()`. You can customise data tables in many ways, but we'll stick with a basic example here.


```r
# in the UI
DT::dataTableOutput("demo_datatable")

# in the server function
output$demo_datatable <- DT::renderDataTable({
    iris
}, options = list(pageLength = 10))
```

<div class="warning">
<p>The basic <code>shiny</code> package has <code>dataTableOutput()</code> and <code>renderDataTable()</code> functions, but they can be buggy. The version in the <code>DT</code> package are better and have some additional functions, so I use those.</p>
</div>



## Reading and saving data

### Local Data

You can read and write data from a Shiny app the same way you do from any R script. We will focus on reading data, since writing data locally can cause problems and is better done with [Google Sheets](#google_sheets).

The base directory for a Shiny app is the directory that app.R is in. I recommend keeping your data in a directory called "data" to keep things tidy.


```r
# read local data
my_data <- readxl::read_xls("data/my_data.xls")

# read data on the web
countries <- readr::read_csv("https://datahub.io/core/country-list/r/data.csv")
languages <- jsonlite::read_json("https://datahub.io/core/language-codes/r/language-codes.json")
```


### Google Sheets {#google_sheets}

One of the best ways to start collecting data with a Shiny app is with Google Sheets. This allows you to collect data to the same place from multiple servers, which might happen if you're running the app locally on more than one computer or through a service like [shinyapps.io](https://shinyapps.io){target="_blank"}. The R package `googlesheets4` makes it easy to work with Google Sheets from R.




If you just want to read data from a public Google Sheet, you don't need any authorisation. Just start your code with `gs4_deauth()` after you load the `googlesheets4` library (otherwise you'll be prompted to log in). Then you can read data like this:


```r
library(googlesheets4)
gs4_deauth()
sheet_id <- "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tQCYQrI4xITlPyxb9dQ-JpMDYeADovIeiZZRNHkctGA/"
read_sheet(sheet_id)
```

<div class="kable-table">

| number|letter |
|------:|:------|
|      1|A      |
|      2|B      |
|      3|C      |

</div>

However, even if a Google Sheet is publicly editable, you can't add data to it without authorising your account.


```r
data <- data.frame(number = 4, letter = "D")
sheet_append(sheet_id, data)
```

```
## Error: Client error: (401) UNAUTHENTICATED
## * Request not authenticated due to missing, invalid, or expired OAuth token.
## * Request is missing required authentication credential. Expected OAuth 2 access token, login cookie or other valid authentication credential. See https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/web/devconsole-project.
```

You can authorise interactively using the following code (and your own email), which will prompt you to authorise "Tidyverse API Packages" the first time you do this.


```r
gs4_auth(email = "debruine@gmail.com")
```

However, this won't work if you want your Shiny apps to be able to access your Google Sheets.

#### Authorisation for Apps

First, you need to get a token and store it in a cache folder in your app directory. We're going to call that directory ".secrets". Run the following code in your console (NOT in an Rmd file). This will open up a web browser window and prompt you to choose your Google account and authorise "Tidyverse API Packages".


```r
setwd(app_directory)
gs4_auth(email = "debruine@gmail.com", cache = ".secrets")

# optionally, authorise google drive to search your drive
# googledrive::drive_auth(email = "debruine@gmail.com", cache = ".secrets")
```

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="images/gs4_choose_account.png" alt="Prompts to choose an account, grant permissions, and confirm." width="30%" /><img src="images/gs4_auth.png" alt="Prompts to choose an account, grant permissions, and confirm." width="30%" /><img src="images/gs4_confirm_auth.png" alt="Prompts to choose an account, grant permissions, and confirm." width="30%" />
<p class="caption">(\#fig:gs4-auth)Prompts to choose an account, grant permissions, and confirm.</p>
</div>

When you have finished, you will see a page that says something like, "Authentication complete. Please close this page and return to R." In the file pane in RStudio, you should now see a directory. called ".secrets" in the app directory.

If you are using GitHub, you don't want to save your secret info to a public repository, so run the following code to ignore any directories called ".secrets" (so they will only exist on your computer and not on GitHub).


```r
usethis::use_git_ignore(".secrets")
usethis::use_git_ignore("*/.secrets")
```

Now, you can include the following code at the top of your app.R script to authorise the app to read from and write to your files.


```r
gs4_auth(cache = ".secrets", email = "debruine@gmail.com")
```

#### Accessing an existing sheet

If you have an existing [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/){target="_blank"}, you can access it by URL.


```r
sheet_id <- "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tQCYQrI4xITlPyxb9dQ-JpMDYeADovIeiZZRNHkctGA/"
data <- data.frame(number = 4, letter = "D")
sheet_append(sheet_id, data)
read_sheet(sheet_id)
```

<div class="kable-table">

| number|letter |
|------:|:------|
|      1|A      |
|      2|B      |
|      3|C      |
|      4|D      |

</div>

#### Make a new sheet

You can set up a new Google Sheet with code. You only need to do this once for a sheet that you will use with a Shiny app, and you will need to save the sheet ID. If you don't specify the tab name(s), the sheet will be created with one tab called "Sheet1". I recommend making only one sheet per app and saving each table in a separate tab.



```r
id <- gs4_create("demo2", sheets = c("demographics", "questionnaire"))
id
```

```
## Spreadsheet name: demo2
##               ID: 1bwXa-eTlCX9Zg2nG1L4iC6Zh1TPZKLjp5zw-LY-HuAU
##           Locale: en_US
##        Time zone: Europe/London
##      # of sheets: 2
## 
##  (Sheet name): (Nominal extent in rows x columns)
##  demographics: 1000 x 26
## questionnaire: 1000 x 26
```




Include the ID at the top of your app like this:

<pre><code>SHEET_ID <- "1bwXa-eTlCX9Zg2nG1L4iC6Zh1TPZKLjp5zw-LY-HuAU"</code></pre>

#### Add data

You can add an empty data structure to your sheet by specifying the data types of each column like this:


```r
data <- data.frame(
  name = character(0),
  birthyear = integer(0),
  parent = logical(0),
  score = double(0)
)

write_sheet(data, SHEET_ID, "demographics")
read_sheet(SHEET_ID, "demographics") %>% names()
```

```
## [1] "name"      "birthyear" "parent"    "score"
```
Or you can populate the table with starting data.


```r
data <- data.frame(
  name = "Lisa",
  birthyear = 1976L,
  R_user = TRUE,
  score = 10.2
)

write_sheet(data, SHEET_ID, "demographics")
read_sheet(SHEET_ID, "demographics")
```

<div class="kable-table">

|name | birthyear|R_user | score|
|:----|---------:|:------|-----:|
|Lisa |      1976|TRUE   |  10.2|

</div>

<div class="info">
<p>Notice that <code>birthyear</code> is a double, not an integer. Google Sheets only have one numeric type, so both doubles and integers are coerced to doubles.</p>
</div>

#### Appending Data

Then you can append new rows of data to the sheet.


```r
data <- data.frame(
  name = "Robbie",
  birthyear = 2007,
  R_user = FALSE,
  score = 12.1
)

sheet_append(SHEET_ID, data, "demographics")
read_sheet(SHEET_ID, "demographics")
```

<div class="kable-table">

|name   | birthyear|R_user | score|
|:------|---------:|:------|-----:|
|Lisa   |      1976|TRUE   |  10.2|
|Robbie |      2007|FALSE  |  12.1|

</div>

If you try to append data of a different type, some weird things can happen. Logical values added to a numeric column are cast as 0 (FALSE) and 1 (TRUE), while numeric values added to a logical column change the column to numeric. If you mix character and numeric values in a column, the resulting column is a column of one-item lists so that each list can have the appropriate data type. (Data frames in R cannot mix data types in the same column.)


```r
data <- data.frame(
  name = 1,
  birthyear = FALSE,
  R_user = 0,
  score = "No"
)

sheet_append(SHEET_ID, data, "demographics")
read_sheet(SHEET_ID, "demographics")
```

<div class="kable-table">

|name   | birthyear| R_user|score |
|:------|---------:|------:|:-----|
|Lisa   |      1976|      1|10.2  |
|Robbie |      2007|      0|12.1  |
|1      |         0|      0|No    |

</div>
<div class="danger">
<p>You must append data that has the same number and order of columns as the Google Sheet. If you send columns out of order, they will be recorded in the order you sent them, not in the order of the column names. If you send extra columns, the append will fail.</p>
</div>


The Shiny template we're working with has a safer version of `sheet_append()` that you can access by uncommenting the line:

`# source("R/sheet_append.R")`

This version gracefully handles data with new columns, missing columns, columns in a different order, and columns with a different data type. However, it reads the whole data sheet before deciding whether to append or overwrite the data, which can slow down your app, so is best used only during development when you're changing things a lot. Once you have the final structure of your data, it's better to use the original `googlesheets4::sheet_append()` function.


## Reactive functions
