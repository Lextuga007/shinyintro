# Structuring a complex app {#structure}

So far, we've been mostly structuring our app entirely in the `r path("app.R")` file, apart from some of the web helper files for `r glossary("CSS")` and `r glossary("JavaScript")`. However, once your apps start getting relatively complex, you might find it easier to move some of the code into external `r path(".R")` files and using `source()` to include them. There are a few things to watch out for when you do this.

## External Server Functions

You can define `r glossary("function", "functions")` you want to use in your app at the top of the `r path("app.R")` file, but that can make that file difficult to parse pretty quickly. The basic template includes external functions with the line:

```{r}
source("scripts/func.R") # helper functions
```

This file contains definitions for the functions `r func("debug_msg")` and `r func("debug_sprintf")`. You can add your own custom functions to this file or to another file that you source in separately.

::: {.warning}
All `r path(".R")` files inside a directory called `r path("R")` will run before the app starts up, even if you don't source them into the app. You can use this to set up any functions your app needs without having to use `r func("source")`, but I prefer to explicitly include external files, so I keep external functions in a directory called `scripts`.

### Sourcing Locally

It can be tricky to use shiny functions to external files. For example, you can't just move the contents of `r func("server")` to an external file called `r path("scripts/logo.R")` and source the file in like this:

```{r}
server <- function(input, output, session) {
    source("scripts/logo.R")
} 
```

You'll get an error like: "Error in output$logo <- renderImage({ : object 'output' not found". This is because the input and output objects only work like you'd expect when they are inside `r func("server")` 

However, you can source in external code inside `r func("server")` by setting the `local` `r glossary("argument")` to TRUE. 

```{r}
server <- function(input, output, session) {
    source("scripts/logo.R", local = TRUE)
} 
```

You might find it useful to break up parts of the server logic for a very big app into separate files like this, but it's more common to keep any code that uses reactive functions inside `r func("server")` in the `r path("app.R")` file, and move large sections of code inside those functions to externally defined functions.

For example, you could define the function `r func("logo_image")` in the external file `r path("scripts/logo.R")` like this:

```{r}
logo_image() <- function() {
  list(src = "www/img/shinyintro.png",
       width = "300px",
       height = "300px",
       alt = "ShinyIntro hex logo")
}
```


The following in the `r path("app.R")` file keeps the reactive function `r func("renderImage")` inside `r func("server")`, but lets you reduce the number of lines of code. 

```{r}
source("scripts/logo.R")

server <- function(input, output, session) {
    source("scripts/logo.R", local = TRUE)
    output$logo <- renderImage(logo_image(), deleteFile = FALSE)
} 
```

### Inputs and Outputs

The objects `input` and `output` aren't available by default to externally defined functions. Let's add an action button to the ui for our app, `actionButton("change", "Change Image")`, and change the `r func("logo_image")` function so that it returns the ShinyIntro logo on odd-numbered clicks of the change button, and the psyTeachR logo on even-numbered clicks.

```{r}
logo_image <- function() {
  odd_clicks <- input$change%%2 == 1
  src <- ifelse(odd_clicks, 
                "www/img/shinyintro.png", 
                "www/img/psyteachr.png")
  
  list(src = src,
       width = "300px",
       height = "300px",
       alt = "ShinyIntro hex logo")
}
```

If you try to run this, you'll get an error message like, "Error in logo_image: object 'input' not found". This is because the external function doesn't have access to reactive objects like `input`, `output`, `session`, or any `r func("reactiveValues")`.

The best solution is to pass any variables to the function that you need. In some circumstances, you can pass the whole `input` object, but that's seldom necessary.

Here, we change `r func("logo_image")` to take a single argument called `r arg("change")` and replace `input$change` with this argument.

```{r}
logo_image <- function(change) {
  odd_clicks <- change%%2 == 1
  src <- ifelse(odd_clicks, 
                "www/img/shinyintro.png", 
                "www/img/psyteachr.png")
  
  list(src = src,
       width = "300px",
       height = "300px",
       alt = "ShinyIntro hex logo")
}
```

Then we just have to pass the value of `input$change` to `r func("logo_image")` inside `r func("renderImage")`, where the `input` object is available.

```{r}
server <- function(input, output, session) {
    output$logo <- renderImage({
        logo_image(input$change)
    }, deleteFile = FALSE)
} 
```

Don't worry too much if this isn't making a lot of sense yet. The main thing I want you to take away from this section is that when you try to move some server code to external files, you might get errors (I frequently do). I hope that will remind you of this lesson and you'll have a better idea about where to start looking for the solution.

## External UI Files

Defining a complex UI can be very challenging. The basic template uses a pattern that I find helpful with apps that have multiple tab items. I assign each tab to an object and then include the tabs of the app in `r func("dashboardBody")`  like this:

```{r}
tabItems(
    intro_tab,
    questionnaire_tab,
    feedback_tab,
    info_tab
)
```

For a simple app, you can define the tabs in `r path("app.R")` just before you define the `ui`. You can do the same for any components of the `ui`, such as `r func("dashboardHeader")` or `r func("dashboardSidebar")`. When the sections start getting complex, you can move them into external files and source them in.

### UI Lists

![](images/structure_ui.png){style="float: right; width: 100%; max-width: 420px;"}

When parts of the UI repeat or can be created programmatically instead of manually, you can use `r func("apply")` or `r func("map")` functions to create a list of UI components. It can be a little tricky to figure out how to add a list of components into the UI, but this can be accomplished with `r func("do.call")`.

Here's an example of how you would programatically create select inputs for each categorical column of the `starwars` dataset from `r pkg("dplyr")` and add them to a `r func("box")`.

```{r}
# get the categorical columns
col_is_char <- sapply(starwars, is.character)
categorical_cols <- names(starwars)[col_is_char]

# set up the selectInputs
select_inputs <- lapply(categorical_cols, function(col) {
  unique_vals <- unique(starwars[[col]])
  
  selectInput(inputId = col, label = col, choices = unique_vals)
})

# add container arguments to select_inputs 
select_inputs$title = "Select the Categories"
select_inputs$solidHeader = TRUE
select_inputs$width = 4

# add to container
select_box <- do.call(box, select_inputs)
```


## Exercises {#exercises-structure}

### server functions

In the app you're developing, see if there are any long functions inside reactive functions in `r func("server")` that can be moved to `r path("scripts/func.R")` or another external file.

### UI files

In the app you're developing, move each tab into an external file and source it into `r path("app.R")`.
